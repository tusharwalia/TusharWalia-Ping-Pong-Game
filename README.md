# Ping-Pong-Game_TusharWalia

This game requires a single player controling 2 bars (top and bottom) which move together when the keys 'A' and 'D' are pressed. The motive of the game is to keep the ball in play from both ends. If the ball hits the top or the bottom edge, the game ends. Score is increased after every successful back and fourth motion of the ball.

## User story
As a child I enjoyed playing computer games, and now I am on a journey where I can develope my own games with my own set of rules.

* Prepare the Folders and Files for the game.
    - create README.md

    - create styles.css
    - create main.js

I used "visual studio code" as my text editor and created some folders and files for my project.
I like to organize everything from the beginning.
